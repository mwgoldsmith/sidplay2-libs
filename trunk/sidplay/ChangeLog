Changes since 2.0.6 (Note this version is intended mainly
for developers):

(ms) Fixed fake6526.cpp to unlock timer upon reset. When playing
sub-tunes and switching from CIA to VBI speed and vice versa, the
speed is now correct.

(ms) Fixed clock to [re]start at 0:00 upon [song] initialization.

(ms) Converted complete source tree from kdevelop to native Automake
and made it build a library and the console player. Developers are
advised to configure the package with --disable-shared, so that they
don't need to install a shared library and/or set the
LD_LIBRARY_PATH, respectively.


Changes:

Resid now linked against library and not against application.  This
means that a application linking to the library does not need to know it's
using resid.

External interface changed to hopefully allow better compatibilty.


Problems:

For OSS left and right channels are reversed.  According to OSS docs,
left channel in writing before right which is the order it's currently
being done.  Both Windows drivers are correct.
	

Bug Fixes:

Fixed bug when reading tunes from stdin.

Added new loadSong function to allow selecting another subsong without
reloading the file.  This is important when reading files from stdin.

External interface changed to hopefully allow better compatibilty.

Fixed IO bug whereby a write to the IO registers could not be read back.

Keyboard input is now read from stderr.  This allows the keyboard to be
read whilst a file is passed using stdin.

Stderr redefined as console output instead of stdout.  This allows you to
redirect or pipe the output whilist allowing keyboard events to be processed
correctly

Changin any of the sid settings effects both sids.

The library can now be configured at run time by putting the library into paused
mode.  If you are using a multiplte threads to drive the library, be carefull
as it's not thread safe.  Use mutually exclusive semaphores to protect the library.

Use of extended keys quiting the program.

	
Added:

Null sound driver to allow faster songlength detection (Code for songlength
detection not provided in this library) and eventual hardsid support.

Cursor keys now work on Linux and Windows.  But there is a bug in Windows 98
first Edition which prevents them from working properly.  This information
has been admitted by Microsoft the the only proposed solution is to upgrade to
Win 98 Second Edition.  (For the time being you can use the cursor keys on
the numpad).

Added a mileage count to help determine the sid usuage since the begining of time.

Added ability to use unforced PAL or NTSC.

For -s, mono songs now get converted to stereo by spliting the
channels between multiple sids.


Removed:

Timer changed test.  This can easily be worked out another way.


	
Release Notes 2.0.6:

This version mainly sees bug fixes and finally gets both the Linux and
Windows versions to exactly the same code state.

Bug Fixes:

Tunes which didn't play.
DirectX fixes.
Timers fixed for both directx and mmsystem drivers and will therefore
never cache ahead by more than 0.5 secs.  This still needs doing under
Linux to prevent the timers getting 3 seconds ahead.
And more...


Added:

Most of the other features of the expermental version now classed as 2.0.5
apart from fastforward/rewind and filter redefinition.
Ability to skip to the prev/next subtune using the '<' and '>' keys.
And more...


Features for next release:

Ansi console support delayed till next release.
Songlength database support delayed.
Filter redefinition delayed.
Fastforward/rewind, delayed indefinately untill feedback is provided
on how good/bad it is (please any feedback at all!).
Player configuration file.



Release Notes 2.0.4-2:

Bug fixes to sid mixer.
Program termination now quicker from ^C.
New xSID code included for testing.
New man page added.
Thanks to those concerened for finding/fixing the bugs in this release.

To follow shortly:
Again 2.0.5 will follow, with the last of the features from my unofficial
experimental version (found on the sidplay2 ftp site).  Be warned that there
are now bug fixes in the main version which the experimental one does not
contain!

From now on experimental versions will be released as patches on the
main release versions in CVS until they are determined to be stable.



Release Notes 2.0.4:

Temporary release to try and bring code upto date.  A 2.0.5 will follow shortly
to achieve all that implemented in  experimental release 2.0.4pre5 (This is available
at ftp://sidplay2.sourceforge.net/pub/sidplay2)

Lots of new options added, bug fixes for Solaris drivers, 16 bit support...  Other
additions will fall into 2.0.5 once they have stabalised.



CHANGES since 2.0.2:

Added:

* Timer

* Support for credits

* Option -fd, overrides values returned by sidtune and forces dual sid support
  with the second sid being mapped at 0xd500.  Use this to support stereo sids
  (not stereo mus) until the format is changed to support them properly.

* Windows Drivers.  Code now now be built as a Win32 console application.
  The include paths need to be changed to Visual C++ so all the headers can
  be seen.  Paths need are PATH/libsidplay-<ver>/ and PATH/libsidplay-<ver>/win.

* Sparc Driver (This driver hasn't been tested or compiled)

* Support for playing of playsid smaples through reSID


Changed:

* Changing the environment whilist the song is playing nolonger stops the song.
  Environment changes are now delayed until a new song is loaded

* environment class renamed to SidEnvironment to avoid some naming issues with
  Visual C++.

* xSID minior fixes to make code compile on Visual C++.

* Structure of audio drivers for better auto detection and Win32 support.

* Sidplayer structure now implements Cheshire Cat techniques to hide private members
  This means that all header files required by private members no longer need to be
  installed

* Added workaround in CPU code for bug found in Visual C++ 5.

* Finally corrected all playsid digi modes using information provided bu
  Michael Schwendt from the original source of Game Over.

* Removed nasty code hacks for Windows.


Fixed:

* xSID bug preventing it from not playing some samples.

* myTune now initialised to NULL (reported by Jarno)

* Placing of an invalid switch on an otherwise legal line did not throw an error.

* Use of bitfields which breaks portability of CPU emulation

* Unions on Big Endian machines where all variables are varying sizes


Issues:

* Timer is actually what has been decoded rather than what has been
  played.  This is due to the soundcard drivers buffer the samples.
  Anyway, it's better than nothing.



CHANGES since 2.0.1:

Added:

* Time count

* xsidplays audio drivers (well linux one)

* Command line options

* Volume controls for left and right

* 8 bit mixer


Changed:

* Renamed the project to libsidplay (eventually this code will be a library).
  main.cpp and the audio directory will form the basis of a new project called
  sidplay-2.X.X.

* Sidtune.  Only need one player emulation for stereo MUS files.

* WavFile now converted to be another driver. (Makes code have better re-use)

* New are now have error checking

* Configure files now work

* Prevented the loadSong function initialising the player twice.



CHANGES since 2.0.0:

Added:

* Extended sid support (xSID, written by myself from scratch).  xSIDs interface is designed to look like reSID and can easily be used to help developers of other players.

* Support for all libsidplay-1.X.X environment modes.

* Stereo SID & MUS file support.

* Sid2Wav support (thanks to Michael Schwendt).


Fixed:

* CPU using wrong address for reset vector.

* The use of statics in CPU a member function (Required to play stereo MUS files).


Changed:

* All data types now use _sidt namespace.

* Better handling of reSID clock calls to seriously reduce CPU overhead.



CHANGES from libsidplay 1.X.X

* Most of the code has been re-written by myself with all the new emulated IC's being cycle based.

* The interface has been revamped and is based on standard functions provided by a music player e.g. play, stop, pause, etc

* reSID is now the default and currently only provided SID emulation. (written by Dag Lem)

* Sidtune library taken from libsidplay-1.X.X for file support. (written by Michael Schwendt)
